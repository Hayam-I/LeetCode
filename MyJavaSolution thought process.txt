BTWWWW a very obvious solution is:

return haystack.indexOf(needle);



Basically i thought okay:

if the haystack doesnt contain the needle then obv return -1.

otherwise
track each character from haystack and needle,
if they are equal, add one to a variable, if by the end that variable and keep track of the index is the same size as the needle then fix the index to the correct beginner one.

it does not pass the case where "hello" is the haystack and "ll" is the needle.

0 , 1

c1 = haystack.charAt(0) = h
c2 = needle.charAt(0) = l

c1 = haystack.charAt(1) = e
c2 = needle.charAt(1) = l

then y = 0 

okayyyyy i get why the output for mine is 0 even tho its supposed to be not that okok.

it doesnt work for me bc up until that testcase, the haystack and the needle started with the same letters and there was a diff in the end of the haystack...double pointer is better i guess.
